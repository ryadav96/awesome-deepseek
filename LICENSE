We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone. Please follow these guidelines to help us achieve that:

- **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but personal attacks are not.
- **Be Constructive:** Provide constructive feedback and avoid dismissive language.
- **Inclusivity:** Respect people of all backgrounds, identities, and opinions.
- **Reporting:** If you experience or witness any unacceptable behavior, please report it to [maintainer@example.com](mailto:maintainer@example.com).

Violations of these guidelines may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the community.
